# Vijnana Lab

**Vijnana Lab** is a modern web application that serves as an interactive experimentation platform / AI-powered workspace.  
It integrates **Google Gemini API** for intelligent features and provides a clean, component-based React frontend with supporting backend/service logic.

**"Vijnana" (विज्ञान) —
Sanskrit for systematic knowledge, science, or consciousness — reflects the project's aim to create a thoughtful, AI-assisted lab-like environment.
