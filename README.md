## ✦ What is Vijnana Lab?

**Vijnana** (विज्ञान) in Sanskrit translates to *systematic knowledge* or *science*. 

We built **Vijnana Lab** to democratize practical science education. Many higher primary and secondary schools lack the funding for fully equipped physical laboratories, or students simply don't get enough hands-on time with instruments. 

Vijnana Lab solves this by providing a suite of **interactive virtual simulators**. Students can use a digital Vernier Caliper, perform a Chemistry Titration safely from their laptops, or visualize complex Math and Biology concepts. With the integration of the Google Gemini API, students even get a built-in AI tutor to explain theories and guide them through their experiments.

### The Problem vs. Our Solution

| The Problem | How Vijnana Lab Solves It |
|---------|----------|
| **Limited Lab Access** — Schools have limited equipment, restricting student practice time. | **24/7 Virtual Labs** — Students can access precise simulators from any browser, at any time. |
| **Safety Concerns** — Chemistry and physics experiments can involve dangerous materials. | **Zero-Risk Environment** — Safely simulate titrations, salt analysis, and circuit building. |
| **Abstract Concepts** — Theories in physics and math are often hard to visualize from textbooks. | **Interactive Visuals** — Hands-on STEM simulators and rich educational charts. |

## ✦ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher)
- **Google Gemini API Key** (To power the AI Tutor features — get one [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/mahi-2-ron/vijnanalab_by_supra.git
cd vijnanalab_by_supra

# Install all the necessary packages
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root folder of the project:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```
> **Note:** Never share or commit your `.env.local` to GitHub. The repository is already set up to ignore it.

### Run Development Server

```bash
# Start the local server
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser to enter the virtual lab! 🎉
